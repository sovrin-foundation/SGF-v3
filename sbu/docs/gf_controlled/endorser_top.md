# 1. General Security Policies
1. Transaction Endorser MUST maintain and follow IT security policies and practices that
are integral to maintain protection of all services provided in association with the
Transaction Endorser Agreement (“Endorser Services”). These policies MUST be
mandatory for all employees of the Endorser involved with providing the Endorser
Services. The Transaction Endorser shall designate its CIO or another officer to provide
executive oversight for such policies, including formal governance and revision
management, employee education, and compliance enforcement.
2. Transaction Endorser MUST review its IT security policies at least annually and amend
such policies as the Endorser deems reasonable to maintain protection of its Endorser
Services.
3. Transaction Endorser MUST maintain and follow its standard mandatory employment
verification requirements for all new hires involved with providing its Endorser Services
and will extend such requirements to wholly-owned subsidiaries involved with providing
its Endorser Services. In accordance with the Transaction Endorser’s internal process
and procedures, these requirements MUST be periodically reviewed and MUST include,
but may not be limited to, criminal background checks, proof of identity validation, and
additional checks as deemed necessary by the Transaction Endorser. Each Transaction
Endorser company is responsible for implementing these requirements in its hiring
process as applicable and permitted under local law.
4. Employees of a Transaction Endorser involved with its Endorser Services MUST
complete security and privacy education annually and certify each year that they will
comply with the Transaction Endorser’s ethical business conduct, confidentiality,
security, privacy, and data protection policies. Additional policy and process training
MUST be provided to persons granted administrative access to components that are
specific to their role within the Transaction Endorser’s operation and support of its
Endorser Services.
5. If a Transaction Endorser performs its Endorser Services in its own data center, the
Transaction Endorser’s security policies MUST also adequately address physical
security and entry control according to industry best practices.
6. If a Transaction Endorser performs its Endorser Services using a third-party Hosting
Provider, the Transaction Endorser MUST ensure that the security, privacy, and data
protection policies of the Hosting Provider meet the requirements in this document.
7. Transaction Endorser MUST make available to the DIBE Consortium upon request
evidence of stated compliance with these policies and any relevant accreditations held
by the Transaction Endorser, including certificates, attestations, or reports resulting from
accredited third-party audits, such as ISO 27001, SSAE SOC 2, or other industry
standards.

# 2. Security Incident Policies
1. Transaction Endorser MUST maintain and follow documented incident response policies
consistent with NIST guidelines for computer security incident handling and will comply
with data breach notification terms of the Transaction Endorser Agreement.
2. Transaction Endorser MUST investigate unauthorized access of which the Transaction
Endorser becomes aware (security incident), and the Transaction Endorser will define
and execute an appropriate response plan. The DIBE Consortium may notify the Transaction
Endorser of a suspected vulnerability or incident by submitting a technical support
request.
3. Transaction Endorser MUST notify the DIBE Consortium without undue delay upon
confirmation of a security incident that is known or reasonably suspected by the
Transaction Endorser to affect the Consortium. The Transaction Endorser will provide
the DIBE Consortium with the reasonably requested information about such security incident
and the status of any of the Transaction Endorser remediation and restoration activities.

# 3. General Technical Policies
In performing its Endorser Services, Transaction Endorser MUST:

1. Comply with all relevant DIBE Consortium Ledger Access Policies.
2. Follow any additional guidelines published by the Technical Governance Board
on the DIBE Consortium website or github site.
