>DIBE CONSORTIUM AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS

## ARTICLE I. NAME OF CORPORATION
The name of the corporation is DIBE Consortium(“Corporation”).

## ARTICLE II. CORPORATE PURPOSE
The general and specific purposes of the Corporation are set forth in the Articles of
Incorporation.

## ARTICLE III. MEMBERSHIP
The Corporation shall have no members for purposes of the Utah Revised Nonprofit Corporation Act.
The term “members” may be used in these Bylaws and in other corporate documents to refer
to donors, technology contributors, ledger stewards, members of Corporation committees or
work groups, and other participants in the Sovrin community whose roles may be further
defined in the Bylaws, agreements, or other governing documents.

## ARTICLE IV. Board of Directors

### Section 1. General Powers
For purposes of the Utah Revised Nonprofit Corporation Act, the use of the term "Trustee" is
intended to include all the powers and responsibilities of a director under the statute.
The affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by its Board of Directors. The Board of Directors
shall have control of and be responsible for the management of the affairs and property of the
Corporation.

### Section 2. Number, Election, Tenure and Nominations
1.  Number. The number of Trustees shall be fixed from time to time by the
Trustees but shall consist of no less than three (3) nor more than twenty‐one (21) persons. The
Chairs of TGB Council and I4A Council shall be ex‐officio members with all the rights of other
board members.


2. Election.
The initial Board of Directors is established by the Articles of Incorporation (the “Initial Trustees”). Trustees up for election shall be elected at the annual
meeting upon the affirmative vote of a majority of Trustees present, provided that a quorum
exists as provided in Section 7 of this Article IV. The members of the Board of Directors shall,
upon election, immediately commence to perform their duties and shall continue in office until
their successors shall be duly elected and qualified.

3. Tenure. The Initial Trustees shall serve for a term of 18 months. Thereafter,
newly elected members of the Board of Directors who have not served before shall serve initial
one‐year terms. At the conclusion of a Trustee’s initial term, the Trustee is eligible to be
considered for re‐election to a term of one to three years, staggered in order to ensure future
orderly transition on the Board. Nominees recommended by the nominating committee may
volunteer for the newly staggered terms for the first election. If the staggered terms are not
evenly distributed, then the Executive Committee will assign Trustees to terms to make them
evenly staggered. Newly added members of the Board of Directors shall serve until the next
regularly scheduled election unless the resulting term would be less than six months in which
case they would serve until the second regularly scheduled election and then if eligible for an
additional term, that term will be set by the Executive Committee to correspond to the already
staggered terms of the Board of Directors as to ensure an even amount of staggered terms
going forward.

4. Nominations. Prior to the completion of the initial Trustees term and annually
thereafter, the Board shall select a nominations committee to present a list to the Board of
Trustees containing names of eligible nominees as Trustees for the ensuing year. Said list shall
contain the names of at least one eligible nominee to each vacancy. In case the Board of
Trustees fails, for any reason, to elect such a committee within the time specified, then it shall
be the duty of the Chair to appoint such a committee. Nominations made by the committee for
the Trustees must be delivered to the Secretary at least thirty (30) days before the completion
of the initial Trustees term and annually thereafter. The Secretary shall attach a list of nominees
to the notification of the March meeting of the Board of Directors annually.

### Section 3. Regular and Annual Meetings
An annual meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held at a time and day in the month of
March of each calendar year and at a location designated by the Board. The Board of Directors
may provide by resolution the time and place, for the holding of regular meetings of the Board.
Notice of the annual meeting, and notice of the first regular meeting under a Board resolution, shall be sent in writing or electronically to all members of the Board of Directors no fewer than
ten (10) days prior to the meeting date, subject to waiver of notice as provided in the Utah
Revised Nonprofit Corporation Act.

### Section 4. Special Meetings
Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by or at the request of the Chairperson
or any two members of the Board of Directors. The person or persons authorized to call special
meetings of the Board of Directors may fix any location as the place for holding any special
meeting of the Board called by them but must give the other Trustees notice at least two (2)
days in advance of the meeting by telephone, electronically, or in writing, subject to waiver of
notice as provided in the Utah Revised Nonprofit Corporation Act. The meeting notice need not
specify the purpose of the meeting.

### Section 5. Participation in Meetings
Any Trustee may participate in an annual, regular, or special meeting of the Board of Directors,
or conduct such a meeting, through the use of any means of communication by which all
participating Trustees may hear each other during the meeting or, in the case of hearing impaired
persons, read the other Trustees’ remarks during the meeting. Trustees participating
by such means shall be counted as “present” for quorum purposes and may participate in
discussion and voting.

### Section 6. Action without Meeting
Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors may be
taken without a meeting, provided there is written notice (which may be electronic) to all
Trustees at least two (2) days in advance and no Trustee objects within the notice period to the
action being taken without a meeting. The proposed action is approved only if it receives the
requisite number of affirmative votes in writing (which may be electronic) under the applicable
quorum and voting requirements herein.

### Section 7. Quorum
The presence of a simple majority of current members of the Board of Directors shall be
necessary at any meeting to constitute a quorum to transact business, but a lesser number shall
have power to adjourn to a specified later date without notice. The act of a majority of the
members of the Board of Directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be
the act of the Board of Directors, unless the act of a greater number is required by law or by
these Bylaws.

### Section 8. Forfeiture
Any member of the Board of Directors who fails to attend three Board meetings in three
consecutive calendar months shall automatically forfeit his or her seat on the Board, unless a
majority of the other Trustees vote to retain the Trustee in question. The Secretary shall notify
the Trustee in writing that his or her seat has been declared vacant, and the Board of Directors
may immediately proceed to fill the vacancy.

### Section 9. Vacancies
Whenever any vacancy occurs in the Board of Directors it shall be filled without undue delay by
a majority vote of the remaining members of the Board of Directors. Vacancies may be created
and filled according to specific methods approved by the Board of Directors.

annually but who shall have no duties, voting privileges, nor obligations for attendance at
regular meetings of the Board. Advisory Council members may attend Board meetings at the
invitation of a Trustee. Otherwise, members of Advisory Councils shall function according to a

the work of the Corporation. Members of Advisory Councils may be required to sign
confidentiality and intellectual property agreements and to comply with committee procedures
approved by the Board.
