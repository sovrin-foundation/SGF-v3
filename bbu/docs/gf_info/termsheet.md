## Optimal Consensus Threshold
A balance between budget requirements and technology limitations will define the number of validator nodes required to operate the Bedrock Business Utility ("BBU"). Initially this will be set at 25. The set of active nodes on the network will be periodically pulled from a pool of available nodes.

## Validator Node Pool
In order to efficiently operate the Ledger associated with the BBU, a combination of production and test nodes are necessary. The BoD is responsible for defining the requirements associated with the validator pool. It is important to note that such BoD decisions will be influence by both technical performance restrictions as well as budgetary demands.

| Framework Facet | Required Quantity | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BoD Seats | 9 | Minimum Founding Stewards. BoD can increase but MUST not exceed 15 |
| Minimum Production Pool Size  | 25 | Considers production and BoD factors. Each Steward must contribute a Test Node. |
| Minimum Stewards | 16 | |
| Minimum Test Pool Size  | 9 | Each Steward must contribute a Test Node.  |

## Board of Directors (BoD)
Founding Members will have the right to appoint a board director. Each Founding Member will be allocated one vote for each appointed Director.
