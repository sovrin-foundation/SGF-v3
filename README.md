# Sovrin ToIP Metasystem Task Force Resources

As the Sovrin Foundation transitions from Governance Framework Version 2 to Version 3, this repo will serve as a source library for all resources associated with the activities of various stockholders.  

The Task Force is focused on the necessary transitional materials and tasks to move to a ToIP Metatsystem whereby the current ```MainNet``` ledger will be split into two separate ledgers (```did:sov:pub```, ```did:sov:biz```) and will allow for additional DID ledgers to be created under the Sovrin Network.
